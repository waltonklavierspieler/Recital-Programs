		<h2 id="subtitle">Notes</h2>
		<h3 class="section-title">Brahms Op. 119</h3>
		<p>Brahms' final work for solo piano showcases his mastery of short-form composition.
		   The deep relationship between Clara Schumann and Brahms is well documented (or, as well
		   documented as possible: Brahms burned many of his correspondences and sketchbooks), and
		   Brahms' Op. 118 and 119 seem written with Clara in mind. Indeed, Clara remarks in her diary
		   that "it really is marvelous how things pour from [Brahms]; it is wonderful how he combines
		   passion and tenderness in the smallest of spaces." </p>
		   <p>The first intermezzo (presented to Clara as a birthday present) shows Brahms at his most 
		   melancholic and pensive. The impressionistic opening immediately yields dissonant, extended 
		   harmonies that portend Debussy's music. Brahms on this piece says "it 
		   teems with discords. . . . it is exceptionally melancholy, and to say “to be played very slowly”
		   is not sufficient. Every bar and every note must be played as if ritardando were indicated, 
		   and one wished to draw the melancholy out of each one of them, and voluptuous joy and comfort 
		   out of the discords. My God, how this description will whet your appetite!" </p>
		   <p>The schizophrenic second intermezzo opens with an agitated theme that is balanced by a languid
		   waltz in the center of the short piece. Brahms demonstrates his mastery of motivic development:
		   nearly every "new" idea is simply an imaginative and economical reworking of the opening melody.</p>
		   <p>The C major intermezzo is marked <em class="italic-word">giocoso</em>, meaning "playfully."
		   A brief, soaring, and joyous <em class="italic-word">diviertimento</em>, it's easy to imagine Brahms
		   employing Robert Schumann's trick: composing in/around the key of C major as a cipher representing Clara.</p>
		   <p>In the final piece of Op. 119 Brahms explores his formidably athletic style at the keyboard. 
		   a smorgasbord of technical devices is on display: jumping octaves, rich chords, hemiola, gymnastic
		   arpeggiation, complex metric rhythm (note the opening melody is in FIVE, not four bars). 
		   Rhapsody unexpectedly in a thunderous E minor coda, as if the C minor material twice represented 
		   in the previous material has shaded the bucolic Eb major material. The choice of Eb minor is significant:
		   the final movement of Op. 118 also explores Eb minor, though in a more jaundiced tone. One wonders if
		   the distant key of Eb minor (with six flats in the key!) serves as the harmonic context for Brahms'
		   ruminations at the end of his career.</p>
		   <p>In this set of short piano pieces, it's easy to hear dreams of unrequited love, dreams of
		   the cerebral Modernist style to come, and dreams of the Romantic period that flowered and began
		   to pass by the end of Brahms' life.		   
		   </p>

	<!-- <div>
		<h3 class="section-title">Schumann <em class="italic-word">Träumerei</em></h3>
		<p>From Schumann's set of short pieces for children, <em class="italic-word">Kinderszenen</em>,
		"Scenes from Childhood." The title literally translates to "dreaming." The wandering, dreamy
		F major interlude serves a fitting segue to the narrative ballads to come.</p>
	</div> -->
	
	<div>
		<h3 class="section-title">The Ballade as Narrative - Chopin Ballade No. 4</h3>
		<p>The ballade form goes all the way back to medieval poetry traditions, and have always been associated
		with narrative qualities: telling an epic or humorous story involving dramatic events with several actors, rather than 
		exploring subjective or abstract ideas like the sensation of love, grief, etc..</p>
		<p>Chopin's ballades, though not bearing any specific programmatic material to associate them with 
		stories proper, have long been associated with the structure and content of folk tales. For instance,
		his second Ballade was reportedly inspired by a ballad poem by Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. Chopin's fourth
		and final ballade stands as one of his finest and most complex works. The bell-like opening on the dominant C major functions
		as a narrator introducing the story, followed immediately by the day-dreaming main theme.</p>
		<p>The ballade meanders through several ideas and tonal areas (Gb major, Db major, A major...), with several
		reoccurences of the first theme idea and the introductory bell-like narrator material returns mid-piece to 
		announce the fiery end of the ballade. Each return of the material suggests a reoccuring character 
		that is on a journey that inexorably alters its character...
		<p> 
	</div>
		
	<div>
		<h3 class="section-title">Rzewski North American Ballads</h3>
		<p>Frederic Rzewski was one of the most interesting and diverse American composers of the late 20th century.
		Polemically dismissed as a "political" composer, Rzewski did not shy away from treating music as a social phenomenon
		that could not be divorced from its social context. As such, Rzewski drew on the sounds of American folk traditions
		and explicitly incorporated coeval musical and political themes into his music. These included protest music, 
		anti-war music, and music on the lives of working people.</p>
		<p>In these ballads, Rzewski displays blues, jazz, and contrapuntal compositional techniques. Simple settings of the 
		folk tune being treated veer into kaleidescopic fragmentations of the theme in several keys and rates of speed at 
		the same time. This polytonal contrapuntal technique is chaotic, yet the identity of the theme is traceable amidst the 
		chaos. Rzewski's style here has been described as a metaphor for the inherently chaotic nature of social and political 
		struggle (as in the protests against the Vietnam War and the struggles of exploited labor against poor working conditions).</p>
		<p>Each piece is based on a familiar song: "Dreadful Memories" on the hardships of coal-mining; "Which Side Are You On?", a 
		call for union organizing; "Down by the Riverside," a swords-to-plowshares hymn tune re-appropriated as anti-war song during
		the Vietnam War; and "Winnsboro Cottonmill Blues" on labor in a cottonmill. Segments of the text are below:</p>
		<p class="song-text">
			<p class="lyrics-title">I. Dreadful Memories (Sarah Ogan Gunning)</p>
			<div class="word">"Dreadful memories, how they linger,<br>
			How they ever flood my soul.<br>
			How the workers and their children<br>
			Died from hunger and from cold.<br><br>

			Hungry fathers, wearied mothers,<br>
			Living in those dreadful shacks,<br>
			Little children cold and hungry<br>
			With no clothing on their backs.<br><br>
			
			.....<br><br>
			
			Really, friends, it doesn't matter<br>
			Whether you are black or white.<br>
			The only way you'll ever change things<br>
			Is to fight and fight and fight.<br><br></div>
			
			<p class="lyrics-title">II. Which Side Are You On? (Florence Reece)</p>
		
			<div class="word">Come all you poor workers<br>
			Good news to you I'll tell<br>
			How that good old union<br>
			Has come in here to dwell<br><br>
			Which side are you on?<br>
			Which side are you on?<br><br>
			
			.....<br><br>
			
			My daddy was a miner<br>
			He's now in the air and sun<br>
			He'll be with you fellow workers<br>
			'Til every battle's won<br><br>
			Which side are you on?<br>
			Which side are you on?<br><br>
			
			Now all of you know which side you're on<br>
			And they'll never keep us down<br><br></div>
			
			<p class="lyrics-title">III. Down By the Riverside</p>
		
			<div class="word">Going to lay down my sword and shield,<br>
			Down by the riverside,<br>
			Down by the riverside,<br>
			Down by the riverside,<br>
			Going to lay down my sword and shield,<br>
			Down by the riverside.<br>
			Going to study war no more.<br><br>
			.....<br><br></div>
			
			<p class="lyrics-title">IV. Winnsboro Cottonmill Blues (adapted Pete Seeger)</p>
		
			<div class="word">Ol' man seargent sittin' at the desk<br>
			The damn ol' fool won't give us no rest<br>
			He'd take the nickels off a dead man's eyes<br>

			I got the blues, I got the blues<br>
			I got the Winnsboro cotton mill blues<br>
			Oh Lordy Lordy spoolin's hard<br>
			You know and I know, we don't have to tell<br>
			You work for Tom Watson gotta work like hell<br>
			I got the blues, I got the blues<br>
			I got the Winnsboro cotton mill blues<br><br>

			When I die don't you bury me at all<br>
			Hang me up on the schoolroom wall<br>
			Place a bobbin in my hand<br>
			So I can keep on a-workin' in the Promised Land<br><br>

			I got the blues, I got the blues<br>
			I got the Winnsboro cotton mill blues<br>
			Oh Lordy Lordy spoolin's hard<br>
			You know and I know, we don't have to tell<br>
