		<h3 class="section-title">Schoenfield Café Music</h3>
		<p>Schoenfield's description of his most performed work gives the listener a good idea of what to expect in this piece: </p>
		<p class="quote">The idea to compose Café Music first came to me in 1985 after sitting in one night for the pianist at Murray’s Restaurant in Minneapolis. Murray’s employs a house trio which plays entertaining dinner music in a wide variety of styles. My intention was to write a kind of high-class dinner music — music which could be played at a restaurant, but might also (just barely) find its way into a concert hall. The work draws on many
of the types of music played by the trio at Murray’s. For example, early 20th century American, Viennese, light classical, gypsy, and Broadway styles are all represented. A paraphrase of a beautiful Chassidic melody is incorporated in the second movement.</p>

		<h3 class="section-title">Schumann <em class="italic-word">Träumerei</em></h3>
		<p>From Schumann's set of short pieces for children, <em class="italic-word">Kinderszenen</em>,
		"Scenes from Childhood." The title literally translates to "dreaming." The wandering, dreamy
		F major interlude serves a fitting segue to the narrative ballads to come.</p>
	</div> -->
	
	<div>
		<h3 class="section-title">Messiaen Quartet</h3>
		<p>I. Crystal liturgy</p>
		<p class="quote">Between three and four in the morning, the awakening of birds: a solo blackbird or nightingale improvises, surrounded by a shimmer of sound, by a halo of trills lost very high in the trees. Transpose this onto a religious plane and you have the harmonious silence of Heaven.</p>
		<p>II. Vocalise, for the Angel who announces the end of time</p>
		<p class="quote">The first and third parts (very short) evoke the power of this mighty angel, a rainbow upon his head and clothed with a cloud, who sets one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth. In the middle section are the impalpable harmonies of heaven. In the piano, sweet cascades of blue-orange chords, enclosing in their distant chimes the almost plainchant song of the violin and cello.</p>
		<p>III. Abyss of birds</p>
		<p class="quote">The abyss is Time with its sadness, its weariness. The birds are the opposite to Time; they are our desire for light, for stars, for rainbows, and for jubilant songs.</p>
		<p>IV. Interlude</p>
		<p class="quote">Scherzo, of a more individual character than the other movements, but linked to them nevertheless by certain melodic recollections.</p>
		<p>V. Praise to the Eternity of Jesus</p>
		<p class="quote">Jesus is considered here as the Word. A broad phrase, "infinitely slow", on the cello, magnifies with love and reverence the eternity of the Word, powerful and gentle, "whose time never runs out". The melody stretches majestically into a kind of gentle, regal distance. "In the beginning was the Word, and Word was with God, and the Word was God." (John 1:1 (King James Version))</p>
		<p>VI. Dance of fury, for the seven trumpets</p>
		<p class="quote">Rhythmically, the most characteristic piece of the series. The four instruments in unison imitate gongs and trumpets (the first six trumpets of the Apocalypse followed by various disasters, the trumpet of the seventh angel announcing consummation of the mystery of God) Use of added values, of augmented or diminished rhythms, of non-retrogradable rhythms. Music of stone, formidable granite sound; irresistible movement of steel, huge blocks of purple rage, icy drunkenness. Listen especially to all the terrible fortissimo of the augmentation of the theme and changes of register of its different notes, towards the end of the piece.</p>
		<p>VII. Tangle of rainbows, for the Angel who announces the end of time</p>
		<p class="quote">Recurring here are certain passages from the second movement. The angel appears in full force, especially the rainbow that covers him (the rainbow, symbol of peace, wisdom, and all luminescent and sonorous vibration). – In my dreams, I hear and see ordered chords and melodies, known colors and shapes; then, after this transitional stage, I pass through the unreal and suffer, with ecstasy, a tournament; a roundabout co-penetration of superhuman sounds and colors. These swords of fire, this blue-orange lava, these sudden stars: there is the tangle, there are the rainbows!</p>
		<p>VII. Praise to the immortality of Jesus</p>
		<p class="quote">Large violin solo, counterpart to the violoncello solo of the 5th movement. Why this second eulogy? It is especially aimed at the second aspect of Jesus, Jesus the Man, the Word made flesh, immortally risen for our communication of his life. It is all love. Its slow ascent to the acutely extreme is the ascent of man to his god, the child of God to his Father, the being made divine towards Paradise.</p>

		<h3 class="section-title">Coda re: Rzewski&mdash;"I'll Fly Away"</h3>
		<p>Rzewski ends each of his four ballads in uncertainty. This new composition treats a familiar tune
		in a similar style, but ends on a more positive note.</p>

			<p class="lyrics-title">I'll Fly Away (Albert E. Brumley)</p>
			<div class="word">Some glad morning when this life is over<br>
			I'll fly away<br>
			To a home on God's celestial shore
			I'll fly away<br><br>
			I'll fly away, oh, Glory<br>
